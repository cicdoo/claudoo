"""PreToolUse hook that sandboxes the Claude Code `Read` tool.

The AI assistant re-enables `Read` so the model can open files the user
attached, but ONLY under the per-session uploads dir. A path-scoped allow rule
is not enough on its own: in `default` permission mode the CLI auto-approves
read-only tools, so an unguarded `Read` could reach any file the odoo user can
(credentials, /etc, the scratch root's mcp.json that holds the bridge token).

This hook runs BEFORE permission evaluation and a `deny` decision overrides that
auto-approval, so it is the real boundary. It reads the hook payload on stdin,
resolves the requested path (following symlinks), and denies anything that does
not resolve to inside the allowed directory passed as argv[1].

Dependency-free and never imports Odoo — it is spawned by the CLI, not Odoo.
